## Conventional Commit Format

```
Type(scope): description

body

[optional footers]
```

Common types:

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation changes
- style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc
- refactor: code restructuring without changing behavior
- perf: performance improvements
- test: adding or updating tests
- build: build system or dependencies
- ci: CI configuration changes
- chore: maintenance tasks

Examples:

- feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
- fix(api): handle null response from user endpoint
- docs: update installation instructions
- refactor(parser): simplify token handling logic

Rules:

- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject/description line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line let it seem like you’re giving a command eg “feat: Add unit tests for user authentication”. Using the imperative mood in commit messages makes them more consistent and commands-like, which is helpful in understanding the actions taken.
- Do NOT include the generated by or any Claude related messages.
